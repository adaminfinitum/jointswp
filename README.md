Not sure if this is standard protocol but rather than forking this project (which, as far as I know, prevents me from using `git pull` in the future), I cloned it and created a repo of my own.

This makes a lot of sense to me (assuming it does what I hope it will) so I can't imagine it is bad etiquette.

If it is, or if there is a better way to be able to get updates from parent repos, please advise.

And now, on with the show...

### A blank, Foundation 5 WordPress theme
A project by [@jeremyenglert](https://twitter.com/jeremyenglert) of The Ad Garage. [Follow me](https://twitter.com/jeremyenglert) on Twitter to keep up-to-date with JointsWP.

### Start with a Solid Foundation
JointsWP is a blank WordPress theme built with [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/), giving you all the power and flexibility you need to build complex, mobile friendly websites without having to start from scratch. This includes a grid system (far superior to the grid found in Bootstrap), basic styling for common elements, Javascript features such as an off-canvas navigation and much, much more.

### Developers Love Joints (don’t we all?)
This theme is meant to be your starting point, not the end product. No need to use child themes (though you can).  It is not full of shortcodes (that you’ll probably never use) or functions that you’ll probably end up removing anyway. And the features it does have, can be easily removed without breaking the rest of the theme.

Feel free to chop up, slice up, murder or improve any part of it you want. This theme is yours, literally.
